# About Me

<img src="Huqiqi.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Qiqi Hu (Chelsey, 胡齐齐)**.<br>

I am a master student at Tsinghua University. I work in Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Thermal Management Engineering and Materials in Shenzhen Intrnational Graduate School, supervised by [Prof. Hongda Du](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/dhd/list.htm). I also used to be a visiting student in Southern University of Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Feng Zheng](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=fengzheng&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1&lang=en).  Before that, I got my undergraduate degree from Qingdao University of School of Computer Science and Technology, and fortunately supervised by [Prof. Hanlin Zhang](https://cst.qdu.edu.cn/info/1072/7423.htm).

My research interests mainly include **thermal management for thermal runaway in LIBs, trustworthy diffusion models and content security in AIGC**.

For a short summary CV, see my [Google Sites page](https://sites.google.com/view/huqiqi).

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and academic collaborations. Please feel free to [email me](mailto:chelseyhu111@gmail.com).
