<br>In my free time, I enjoy cycling and jogging. These activities are not only great for staying active, but they also give me the chance to discover new routes and experience different scenery along the way. I find that being outdoors and seeing changing landscapes helps me recharge and stay inspired.

## Playing guitar

<br>I  find solace in playing the guitar. It's more than just a pastime; it's a form of meditation and a channel for my creativity. Learning new pieces and techniques keeps my mind engaged, while the music itself brings me peace and a sense of accomplishment.
